# Password Generator
This is an in-browser application that makes use of JavaScript to randomly generate a password, based on the criteria that the user sets. 

The user is able to determine the length of password and which types of characters are included, from a series of prompts/confirms. 

The user then presses the 'generate password' button and their password will appear in the box.
